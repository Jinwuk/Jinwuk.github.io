This category deals with video processing. Especially, most articles are focused on the video encoding, processing using open source solutions such as FFmpeg, AviSynth and so on.  Since I have researched video processing for 20 years, I have a lot of tips about the video processing based on such an open source. Some tips are old and those are not effective anymore. However, the others are still effective so that I'd like to share such tips to anybody who wants to know.

As you see, most articles are written in the Korean language.  However, I think it is not so difficult to understand, with the help of a Web translator solution.
