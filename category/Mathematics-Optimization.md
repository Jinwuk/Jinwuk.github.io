In this category, I'd like to post my lecture notes which are used in UST class.  Most of  posts are pure lecture notes. However, I have a plan to add a new topic about the issue which is arised from the optimization problem in machine learning.  Mosr of articles in this category are written with English, but some comments are with Korean.   Moreover, the articles will be modified as I find a new theories or wrong themes.
