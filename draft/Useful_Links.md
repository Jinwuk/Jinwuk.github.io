## Useful Links 
For the purpose of writing without Microsoft's office solution or windows OS, I introduce some useful links for the writing of markdown, drawing solution as like VISIO, and others, here.

### Markdown 
I think the following link may be the best markdown editing page on Web. It supports full latex based markdown and beautiful preview of the markdown. 

[Online Upmath editor](https://upmath.me/)

### LaTex

The Codecogs page is so famous so that I think it may not be necessary to introduce it here. However, when you forget an appropriate latex symbol for your math, I think, the codecog's online latex editor page is still effective to you.

[Online Latex Editor on CodeCogs](http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php)  

Sometimes, when you should write a math on the Microsoft Word or the Powerpoint, the MathML code will help you. You can get an appropriate MathML code the following link.  

[Hostmath](http://www.hostmath.com/)

When you don't have any information about a special math symbol in LaTeX, this site will help you.

[detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)

Finally, I strongly suggest the alternative Powerpoint solution in the Libre office when you need a math in your drawing a diagram. This solution provides the LaTeX editor for the diagram. 

### Diagram (as like MS's VISIO)

If you don't want to install the Libre office even though you still need a beautiful diagram with a math, I suggest the following web-based drawing diagram solution.
- The Mermaid which is provided by the most markdown editor solution such as the Typora cannot support LaTeX symbols up to now. I wish the solution of supporting LaTeX in the Mermaid to be developed as fast as possible.
