  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe a new gradient method for
	maximizing general functions. After a brief discussion of various
	known gradient methods the mathematical foundation is laid for the
	new algorithm which rests on maximizing a quadratic approximation
	to the function on a suitably chosen spherical region. The method
	requires no assumptions about the concavity of the function to be
	maximized and automatically modifies the step size in the lifet of
	the success of the quadratic approximation to the function. The paper
	further discusses some practical problems of implementing the algorithm
	and presents recent computational experience with it.},
