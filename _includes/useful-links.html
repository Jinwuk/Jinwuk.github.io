<body><h2>Useful Links</h2>
<p>For the purpose of writing without Microsoft&#39;s office solution or windows OS, I introduce some useful links for the writing of markdown, drawing solution as like VISIO, and others, here.</p>
<h3>Markdown</h3>
<p>I think the following link may be the best markdown editing page on Web. It supports full latex based markdown and beautiful preview of the markdown. </p>
<p><a href='https://upmath.me/'>Online Upmath editor</a></p>
<h3>LaTex</h3>
<p>The Codecogs page is so famous so that I think it may not be necessary to introduce it here. However, when you forget an appropriate latex symbol for your math, I think, the codecog&#39;s online latex editor page is still effective to you.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php'>Online Latex Editor on CodeCogs</a><br/></p>
<p>Sometimes, when you should write a math on the Microsoft Word or the Powerpoint, the MathML code will help you. You can get an appropriate MathML code the following link.<br/></p>
<p><a href='http://www.hostmath.com/'>Hostmath</a></p>
<p>When you don&#39;t have any information about a special math symbol in LaTeX, this site will help you.</p>
<p><a href='http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html'>detexify</a></p>
<p>Finally, I strongly suggest the alternative Powerpoint solution in the Libre office when you need a math in your drawing a diagram. This solution provides the LaTeX editor for the diagram. </p>
<h3>Diagram (as like MS&#39;s VISIO)</h3>
<p>If you don&#39;t want to install the Libre office even though you still need a beautiful diagram with a math, I suggest the following web-based drawing diagram solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mermaid which is provided by the most markdown editor solution such as the Typora cannot support LaTeX symbols up to now. I wish the solution of supporting LaTeX in the Mermaid to be developed as fast as possible. </li>

</ul>
